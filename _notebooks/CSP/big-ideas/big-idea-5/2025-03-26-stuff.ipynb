    "Crowdsourcing is when a lot of people work together to share ideas, solve problems, or collect data, usually online. It’s important today because it helps companies, scientists, and creators get more ideas and information faster. There are different types, like crowdfunding (raising money), crowd creation (making content), crowd voting (choosing the best ideas), and crowd wisdom (solving problems together). Distributed computing makes crowdsourcing even better by letting many computers work on big tasks at the same time, like finding new medicines or studying space. Data crowdsourcing helps open-source projects by giving free information for research, like how Wikipedia collects facts from people around the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the future, crowdsourcing could lead to even bigger discoveries and inventions because more people can help solve important problems together. It makes sharing knowledge easier, so anyone can be part of innovation"
