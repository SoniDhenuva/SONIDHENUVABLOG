## Helping CSSE Students with Development Setup
<br>

- Used my 2 years of CS experience at Del Norte to help CSSE students set up their development environments.  
- Helped Adya, a CSSE student, connect to WSL, install requirements, and set up a virtual environment.  
- Gained experience in mentoring and supporting peers while reinforcing my own technical knowledge.

## Connect Four game

- Our team decided to create a connect four game for our lesson to teach the CSSE kids
- We have a few a challenges for the CSSE student to try out, for example we have a challenegs where they have to try to turn the background of the screen red or yellow depending on whose turn it is. The second challeneg is to have a plpace where you can input team names instead of team "red" and team "yellow". The final challenge is to create a local storge leader board.
