# Score and Reflection
<br>
<br>
Score: 50/66
<br>

### What you learned from quiz?
- I learned a lot about my strengths and weakness taking this quiz. Over the my years of coding i relized that understanding the code itself and what it was doing wasnt too hard, but some knowlegde of general concepts of bytes, data storage, cloud servers and cyber knowledge was lacking.

<br>
<br>

### What type of questions do you feel you are week on?
- I feel that is truglled an tend to guess on the general concepts of bytes, data storage, cloud servers and cyber knowledge was lacking. But i felt comfortable undertsanding basic functions of what the code is doing.

<br>
Correction: This option is incorrect. With these inputs, the AND gate will produce an output of false and the first OR gate will produce an output
of true. The second OR gate will have one false input and one true input, causing the circuit to have an output of true.
<br>
![q7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3f84ae1-b241-4c15-8330-c294958ff29b)
